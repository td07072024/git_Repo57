The Betwa (Sanskrit: वेत्रावती) is a river in Central and Northern India, and a tributary of the Yamuna. It rises in the Vindhya Range (Raisen) just north of Hoshangabad (Narmadapuram) in Madhya Pradesh and flows northeast through Madhya Pradesh and enters Uttar Pradesh after flowing through Orchha.[1] Nearly half of its course, which is not navigable, runs over the Malwa Plateau. The confluence of the Betwa and the Yamuna rivers is in Hamirpur district in Uttar Pradesh where Yamuna flows north and Betwa flows just south of Hamirpur.[1]

The Indian navy named one of its frigates INS Betwa in honour of the river.[2]
