The Betwa River is being linked with the Ken River as a part of the river linking project in Madhya Pradesh. Latterly the National Board for Wildlife (NBWL) has given its clearance for the Ken-Betwa inter-linking of rivers (ILR) project. Another noteworthy project on the Betwa River is the construction of the Matatila Dam, an undertaking between the states of Madhya Pradesh and Uttar Pradesh. The region is important for migratory waterbirds.[4] The project to link Ken and Betwa rivers has raised environmental concerns: "Proponents of the project, led by the Union Water Ministry, say that the proposed Daudhan dam and the 2.5 km [1.6 mi] canal — the key structures of the project — that will transfer surplus water from the Uttar Pradesh section of the Ken to the Betwa in Madhya Pradesh are critical to irrigate nearly 700,000 hectares [1,700,000 acres] in drought-ravaged Bundelkhand. However, environmentalists say that such a dam will submerge at least 4,000 hectares of Madhya Pradesh's Panna tiger reserve, whose tigers were almost lost to poaching in 2009 and have only recently been partially replenished. They allege that most districts in Madhya Pradesh will not actually get the promised water. There are vultures in the region, whose nests will be threatened by the height of the dam."
